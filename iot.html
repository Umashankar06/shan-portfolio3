    <h1>IoT Platforms</h1>
    <p>
     IoT platforms connect devices, sensors, and applications, enabling real-time data collection, automation, and monitoring in areas like smart homes, healthcare, and industry. I have experience with Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi for building IoT prototypes and solutions.

I work with communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP, Zigbee, and BLE to ensure reliable data transfer between devices and cloud platforms. I use AWS IoT Core, Firebase, and ThingSpeak for secure data storage, processing, and visualization.

For development and automation, I leverage tools like Node-RED for wiring devices and APIs, Blynk for mobile control, Docker for containerized deployments, and Git/GitHub for version control.

My IoT projects include smart home automation, health monitoring systems, industrial machine monitoring, and agriculture IoT applications, integrating sensors, cloud services, and real-time dashboards for actionable insights.
